# wut
Let's try make a Wii U Toolchain / SDK for creating rpx/rpl.

Licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).

## Requirements
devkitPPC

## Usage
Not very useful until I finish the elf2rpl tool. But these current scripts output an elf nice and ready for conversion!
